## About The Project

The SMS Spam Detection project utilizes machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). It begins with collecting a dataset of labeled SMS messages and preprocessing the text data to remove noise and standardize the format. Features like word frequency and TF-IDF scores are extracted to represent each message effectively. Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models are explored and trained on the dataset. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess the model's performance. Upon deployment, the trained model can classify incoming SMS messages in real-time, providing users with a proactive solution to filter out unwanted communications. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the system's reliability and adaptability to evolving spamming techniques. Overall, the project enhances user experience by mitigating the impact of spam messages and contributes to advancing NLP and machine learning applications in cybersecurity and communication domains.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

pip install wordcloud
pip install NLTK

### Installation

Download anaconda and use their jupyter notebook or just add these command in the command prompt. https://www.anaconda.com/download

## Usage

SMS spam detection ML models automatically identify and block unwanted text messages, ensuring users receive only relevant and legitimate content. By analyzing message content and metadata, these models filter out spam, scams, and phishing attempts, safeguarding users from potential harm and distractions. They enhance user experience by reducing clutter and protecting against security threats posed by malicious links or malware. Moreover, compliance with regulations regarding unsolicited messages is ensured, fostering trust and adherence to legal standards. Ultimately, SMS spam detection models optimize communication channels, promoting efficiency, security, and user satisfaction in mobile messaging environments.
